       <B> What is Java?</b> <br>
        Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. 
        It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today.
        Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. 
        Because Java is a free-to-use and a versatile language, it builds localized and distributed software.
        It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.
    </p>
 Some common uses of Java include: 
    1.     Game Development
    2.     Cloud computing
    3.     Big Data
    4.     Artificial Intelligence
    5.     Internet of Things
<bR><b>How does Java work?</b><br>
    All programming languages are a means to communicate with machines. Machine hardware only responds to electronic communication. High-level programming languages like Java act as a bridge between human language and hardware language. To use Java, a developer needs to understand two things
    1. Java language and APIs
    This is the front-end communication between the developer and the Java platform
    2. Java Virtual Machine
This is the back-end communication between the Java platform and the underlying hardware.Letâ€™s look at each of these in detail below.
